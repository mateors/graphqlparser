# GraphQL Parser
GraphQL has been released only as a specification. This means that GraphQL is in fact not more than a long document that describes in detail the behaviour of a GraphQL server.

## GraphQL Client Libraries
GraphQL is particularly great for frontend developers since it completely eliminates many of the inconveniences and shortcomings that are experienced with REST APIs, such as over- and underfetching. Complexity is pushed to the server-side where powerful machines can take care of the heavy computation work. The client doesn't have to know where the data that it fetches is actually coming from and can use a single, coherent and flexible API.
